                <p>In order to secure all that is best in the education of child maximum cooperation between parents and school authorities is necessary. We earnestly recommend that parents or guardians look into their children’s school diary everyday, and see that the lessons and homework assigned for the next day are all done. Remarks made in diary should be seen and counter signed regularly In case of any difficulty kindly contact the Principal, Vice-Principal / Headmistress. Private tuitions are not permitted. If there be need for help, remedial classes are arranged by school for students on every Saturday.</p>
                <p>Withdrawal of your child from classes for mere social functions and outing is not recommended because it retards the child’s progress in school and his respect for regular hard work and failure to progress in studies.</p>
